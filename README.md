Problem Statement #2 :
Building a new Employee Security System (Machine Learning)

You, as the Security analyst, at Stark Industries, have been tasked to build a new contactless employee check-in system. Currently the employees use a physical keycard for entry into the building like shown below.You have come up with a new idea that uses the employees smartphone and machine learning to provide a contactless system where when an employee enters the firm’s territory, his or her smartphone connects to the server and transmits data from the employee smartphone sensor data like the accelerometer's data. The server performs the calculations and determines this person as one of the employees using Gait analysis. Essentially it compares the current pattern of the employee’s gait with the historial pattern and if there is a match, the doors automatically open for the employee to walk in.To test your idea, you have built a dataset of 30 employees and their daily activities here. Design and develop a system that will perform the gait analysis. Tip : Use Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite - Apps on Google Play to simulate the real time data collection from a person’s phone to test your model accuracy with real world data.

procudure:

1.Dataset is collected from 30 employees performing different activities with smart phone. 

2.Import the python libaries after the data loading processinf will occur.

3.The data can be split into two type training and testing.

4.Atlast we can predict the output.
